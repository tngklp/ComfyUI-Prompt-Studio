# Model adapters

The local adapter uses llama-cpp-python/GGUF for text generation and, with a
compatible projector, Gemma 4 images and ordered video contact sheets. Projector
discovery controls vision capabilities instead of blocking text-only T2VA, and
the adapter owns CUDA offload.

`gguf_backend.py` owns local llama-cpp-python loading, tokenization,
cancellation, and unloading. `external_server_backend.py` independently owns
the specialized local llama.cpp HTTP/SSE connection. `ollama_backend.py` owns
the native Ollama contract. `api_provider_backend.py` owns one generic Chat
Completions transport with OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, and Custom presets.

Qwen preflight reuses a lightweight tokenizer handle implemented by
`vocab_tokenizer.py`. It opens the GGUF with `vocab_only=True` and
`n_gpu_layers=0`; exact text counting therefore happens before full model
loading without allocating model weights or GPU layers. Prepared media
dimensions are carried through assembly so Qwen context planning can budget the
projector tokens for each image and video contact sheet.

All backends supply a narrow `complete(...)` callable to `backend/pipeline.py`.
The pipeline owns shared media messages, Thinking fallback, prompt audit, narrow
repair, and normalized generation metrics. It does not own provider preflight,
transport, or lifecycle.

The extension does not install the full Unsloth runtime. Unsloth GGUF files are
loaded directly with llama.cpp. `requirements-gguf.txt` installs the adapter.
GGUF architecture adapters own loading compatibility only. Exact metadata
lineages are resolved separately in `gguf_policies.py`; a custom `qwen35`,
`qwen3vl`, or `qwen3vlmoe` model does not inherit Qwen 3.8 reasoning effort or
sampling by architecture alone. Exact non-policy pair verification is also kept
separate from sampling policy.

Audio files remain declared references. The local adapter does not analyze their
signal and must not infer unheard content.

`external_server_backend.py` uses the same request assembly, contact sheets,
prompt audit, and narrow repair pipeline while sending chat completions to an
already-running local OpenAI-compatible `llama-server`. It does not inherit from
the Direct GGUF backend. The remote process owns model loading, context, KV
cache, and unloading; the adapter never stops or unloads that process.

`api_provider_backend.py` keeps session credentials only in backend memory. It does not read API keys from
environment variables. Browser storage receives only non-secret connection
configuration. The shared transport handles HTTPS/loopback HTTP, SSE, usage,
best-effort cancellation, and normalized errors. Presets only map endpoint,
output-token, reasoning, model metadata, and disclosure differences; they are
not separate backends. Custom remains generic OpenAI-compatible and does not use
llama.cpp `/health`, `/props`, context, KV, or lifecycle semantics.

Gemini exposes its official Minimal/Low/Medium/High reasoning choice in the
Gemini preset and owns the combined reasoning/output budget. Other API presets
do not expose the app's local Thinking toggle. A loopback Custom endpoint is
optionally enriched from LM Studio's `/api/v1/models` metadata when that exact
shape is available; this enables reported vision/context capabilities and
suppresses LM Studio's default hidden reasoning without turning Custom into a
separate backend.
